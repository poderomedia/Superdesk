Livedesk requires Python 3.2 with standard libraries.

2. Java
Version 1.5 or later. The 'java' binary must be in the system path.


INSTALLATION FROM SOURCES (FOR DEVELOPERS)
-------------------------------------------

1. Install the Ally-Py framework
See https://github.com/sourcefabric/Ally-py

2. Create a Livedesk directory inside Ally-Py directory and copy the content
of this package. Build eggs by running the following command:
[path_to_python3.2] [path_to_livedesk]/build-eggs

3. Create the configuration files by running the following command:
[path_to_python3.2] [path_to_livedesk]/distribution/application.py -dump

E.g.: python3 /var/opt/ally-py/livedesk/distribution/application.py -dump
In this example the content of the package was copied in the
/var/opt/ally-py/livedesk directory and python3 binary is in the system path.

4. Start the REST Ally server by running the following command:
[path_to_python3.2] [path_to_livedesk]/distribution/application.py

5. The admin interface can be accessed from a browser on the same system at
the URL: http://localhost:8080/content/lib/core/start.html

Access from the Internet
------------------------
In order to access the application from other machines the following changes
need to be done:

1. Edit the file 'distribution/application.properties', search for
the property 'server_host' and change it to '0.0.0.0'
E.g.: server_host: 0.0.0.0

2. Edit the file 'distribution/plugins.properties', search for the
property 'server_url' and change it to '[machine_name_or_ip]:8080
E.g.: server_url: my.machine.domain.com:8080

3. Restart the REST Ally server.

Embedding Livedesk into your site
---------------------------------

In order to embed the output of your liveblog into your site take the
following steps:

1. Open the admin interface (see above)
2. Select the blog that you want to embed from the menu
3. Click 'Configure Blog' button 
4. Copy the content of the field 'This Blogs embed script' and paste it
into your site content.

Changing the database server
----------------------------

Edit the file plugins.properties, search for db_superdesk.database_url and
modify the URL. E.g.:
db_superdesk.database_url: mysql+mysqlconnector://root:@localhost/livedesk

The URL is a string in the form
    ``dialect+driver://user:password@host/dbname[?key=value..]``, where
    ``dialect`` is a database name such as ``mysql``, ``oracle``, 
    ``postgresql``, etc., and ``driver`` the name of a DBAPI, such as 
    ``psycopg2``, ``pyodbc``, ``cx_oracle``, etc.  Alternatively, 
    the URL can be an instance of :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL`.
